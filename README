1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
R is free software distributed under a GNU-style copyleft. R-Forge is
a service for R users and package developer providing certain tools for
collaborative source code management.

2. The Directory you're in
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the repository of your project. It contains two important
pre-defined directories namely 'www' and 'pkg'. They must not be
deleted or you do without certain functionality like daily check and
build of your package or project websites.

3. 'pkg' directory
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains your R source code (in subdir R). You should
consider the R package tree (see 'Writing R Extension' for more
details.
Furthermore this directroy will be checked out daily to a build
directory. Afterwards the check process is applied. If it passes this
procedure it is going to be build and made available at
http://download.r-forge.wu-wien.ac.at (as source tar.gz and win32
.zip).
