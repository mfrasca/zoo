\title{ Make a vector unique }
\description{
  Make a vector unique 
}
\usage{
make.unique.approx(x, ...)
\method{make.unique.approx}{default}(x, quantile = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{Vector.  Vector of a class which has differences that can be coerced to numeric for which the difference, when added to the first value, returns the
second value. }
  \item{quantile}{A number between 0 and 1 such that if it is 0 then
the first time value among dplicates is kept as is and the others
calculated via linear interpolation or if 1 then the last time value is
kept as is and the others calculated via linear interpolation.  If
an intermediate fraction is used then that quantile is kept as is.}
   \item{\dots}{Further arguments.}
}

\value{
The function returns \code{x} except among any set of repeated elements
the one at the position whose quantile is indicated is left as is and
all others are linearly interpolated.
